## Opening issues
Feel free to report bugs and request features.

## Creating pull requests
We accept PRs that fix bugs and implement/extend features. When working on a PR, please follow these recommendations:
* Follow [Microsoft's coding guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) (use method syntax for LINQ).
* Do NOT fix formatting of code that is already present. This makes pull requests difficult to read.
* As a recommendation, keep your PRs goal-specific and work on them on dedicated branch.

Here are helpful guides on how to [fork and create a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
