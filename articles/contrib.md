# How to contribute

Contributions are always welcome. Consider joining our discord server [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/772894170451804220.svg)](https://discord.gg/gQBtqyXChu), where we discuss our plans and progress.
A list of wanted features can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian/projects). See here for a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get started on.

## Opening issues

Feel free to report bugs and request features. Our GitHub issues can be found [here](https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian/issues).

## Creating pull requests

We accept PRs that fix bugs and implement/extend features. When working on a PR, please follow these recommendations:

* Follow [Microsoft's coding guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) (use method syntax for LINQ).

* Do NOT fix formatting of code that is already present. This makes pull requests difficult to read.

* As a recommendation, keep your PRs goal-specific and work on them on dedicated branch.

Here are helpful guides on how to [fork and create a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
